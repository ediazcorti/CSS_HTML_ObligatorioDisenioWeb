# CSS_HTML_ObligatorioDisenioWeb
Semantic HTML; CSS practice (without responsive design yet)

PROJECT SCOPE:
Practice project made to show knowledge about semantic HTML; Selectors in CSS and other functions like FlexBox and Grid methods while testing classes, IDs and heritage.

Absence of responsive design functions:
There is not too much of responsive design in this project more than a couple common lines. We have learned to use Bootstrap for different devices and how to manage media queries right after this project, which was tested in an on-site exam, recreating mock sites for each device's size. That was not applied here.

Just a bit of animations and transitions were made for fun:
Animations were also not requested, but I have implemented some for fun in here, thus the comments for the professor to know that I have had some ideas around animating some elements just to practice by fun.


NOTE: I am able to update this project to have a responsive design if it is requested for any interview as a proof of knowledge or anything similar. 
I am also aware that class/id efficence can be upgraded too if needed.
